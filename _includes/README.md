# Davide Moscatelli academic website

This is a statically-generated Jekyll/Liquid/Bootstrap-based website. We created thanks to the high quality model of :
[Dr. Spencer H. Bryngelson](https://bryngelson-research.com/).

We are quite grateful to him to have given us the possibility to easily create our own Website. He also help us to solve some problems.

We suggested to do the same following the [Instructions](https://bryngelson-research.com/aboutwebsite.html) and the [Repository](https://github.com/sbryngelson/sbryngelson.github.io).

  abstract: "Differently from most transformed cells, cutaneous melanoma expresses the pleiotropic factor thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1). Herein, we show that TSP-1 (RNA and protein), undetectable in four cultures of melanocytes and a RGP melanoma, was variously present in 13 cell lines from advanced melanomas or metastases. Moreover, microarray analysis of 55 human lesions showed higher TSP-1 expression in primary melanomas and metastases than in common and dysplastic nevi. In a functional enrichment analysis, the expression of TSP-1 correlated with motility-related genes. Accordingly, TSP-1 production was associated with melanoma cell motility in vitro and lung colonization potential in vivo. VEGF/VEGFR-1 and FGF-2, involved in melanoma progression, regulated TSP-1 production. These factors were coexpressed with TSP-1 and correlated negatively with Slug (SNAI2), a cell migration master gene implicated in melanoma metastasis. We conclude that TSP-1 cooperates with FGF-2 and VEGF/VEGFR-1 in determining melanoma invasion and metastasis, as part of a Slug-independent motility program."

  abstract: "The advent of nanotechnology in medicine has allowed to eliminate the toxic excipients that are often necessary to formulate lipophilic drugs in clinics. An example is paclitaxel, one of the most important chemotherapeutic drugs developed so far, where the Cremophor EL has been eliminated in the Genexol and Abraxane formulations. However, the complex procedures to synthesize these formulations hamper their cost-effective use and, in turn, their distribution among the patient population. For this reason, a simplified method to formulate this drug directly at the bed of the patient has been adopted. It requires only the use of a syringe and it starts from a native dry amphiphilic biodegradable and biocompatible block-copolymer obtained via the combination of the reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer polymerization and ring-opening polymerization. In this way, a novel paclitaxel formulation with the same drug pharmacological properties, but without the use of the Cremophor EL, can be produced. In addition, as long as these nanoparticles are engineered to act as solubility enhancers, a lower burden for its approval from the pharmaceutical regulatory agencies is also expected."

  abstract: "Quantum chemistry was used to investigate the gas phase and surface chemistry active during the MOCVD of ZnSe from H2Se and Zn(CH3)2. Energies, structures and transition-state geometries of gas phase and surface species and reactions were determined with a density functional theory. The surface structure was represented through clusters. It was found that the direct reaction between H2Se and Zn(CH3)2 is too slow to explain the formation of adducts experimentally observed. An alternative pathway, based on a radical chain mechanism started from the desorption of CH3 from the surface, occurring during the growth process, was thus proposed. A pathway to the formation of large adducts composed of fast radical gas phase reactions was identified and kinetic constants for each reactive step were determined. Simulation of an experimental reactor showed that this mechanism is able to explain the formation of adducts in the gas phase and the observed growth rates. Then the role of N(Et)3 was investigated. It was found that its effect in preventing gas phase pre-reactions is due to its strong interaction with small ZnSe adducts, thus preventing the formation of larger adducts. On the contrary, its interaction with Zn(CH3)2 is small because of the mutual repulsion between methyl and ethyl groups. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."

  abstract: "Micromachining processes deal with the production of parts characterized by features in the micro range (i.e., with dimension lower than 1 mm). Several works are present in literature analyzing the tool behaviors, the material influence on the process, and the machine design. In fact, the downsize of the process up to the microscale needs a full review of all the knowledge coming from the meso and macro scale. As a consequence, machines suitable for micromachining processes were recently introduced in the market. Usually, these machines are classified by the classical gantry layout structure supported by a granite frame and, in order to guarantee the needed requirements of precision and accuracy in the micro scale, they are based on fluid-supported axes and active and/or passive vibration control systems. This paper proposes a new concept design: a high precision machine (HPM) based on an innovative layout exploiting a differential mechanism with three motors for two degrees of freedom using pulleys and metal belts. This new layout exhibits relevant advantages. The most significant is that all the worktable servo drives, that moves along x and y axes, are ground-fixed. This allows to isolate the working area of the machine from the servo drives. The system of pulleys and belts holding the working table slides on air bearings in order to minimize the micro vibrations induced by all the drives. A further peculiarity of the machine consists of the double z-axis each of them is motorized by a micrometer slide with linear absolute encoder. The first z-axis is equipped with a spindle for performing micro machining processes (drilling and milling). The second z-axis is equipped with a laser head for micro ablation. The servo drives of the two z-axes are controlled by the same control system of the worktable. Another important feature of the proposed layout is that the differential configuration of the xy mechanism admits the use of a constant speed signal to each control reference with no output displacements. This allows to guarantee non-inversion of motion of the servo-drives and so the avoidance of problems due to backlash and/or static friction. Drives are controlled by position and speed control loops with PID architecture, antiwindup and feed forward strategies. Controllers have been tuned by the use of a genetic algorithm applied to a dynamic model of the system. As a general consideration, the quality of the investigated micro machining processes can be improved with the designed machine structure."

With this aim, we developed a library of engineered polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) of tuneable size and surface properties and evaluated their interaction with podocytes. NP cytotoxicity, uptake, and cytoskeletal effects on podocytes were first assessed. On the basis of these data, nanodelivery of dexamethasone loaded into selected biocompatible NPs was successful in repairing damaged podocytes. Finally, a three-dimensional in vitro system of co-culture of endothelial cells and podocytes was exploited as a new tool for mimicking the mechanisms of NP interaction with glomerular cells and the repair of the kidney filtration barrier."

  abstract: "The market of cosmetic and personal care products is continuously growing its impact. In particular, the products that are currently driving this growth have a strict connection with fragrances (e.g., perfumes, detergents, body creams, and softeners). Since the fragrances are volatile molecules, very often, they are encapsulated in polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) that mediate their release and hence prolong the fragrance perception. Toward this aim, it is highly desirable to maximize the interaction between the carrier and the substrate, which would avoid the NP desorption following scrubbing and repeated washing. In the case of laundry products, limited NP desorption is also crucial to prevent the accumulation of nanoplastics in the environment, which is nowadays strictly regulated. Therefore, a thorough study highlighting the influence of the different physicochemical properties of the NPs on their adsorption behavior is urgently required. In this work, we synthesized polymer NPs with different sizes, surface charges, glass transition temperatures, and degrees of cross-linking through emulsion free-radical polymerization to investigate how these parameters affect the NP adsorption onto a textile substrate (composition: 90% cotton/10% elastane). This study can provide interesting guidelines in the design of new fragrance delivery systems as well as in the optimization of those already adopted in the market. Finally, we investigated the possibility of loading and mediating the release in air of limonene, one of the most common odorous molecules in the cosmetic field, overcoming its well-known volatility."

  abstract: "The translational potential of cell therapy to humans requires a deep knowledge of the interaction between transplanted cells and host tissues. In this study, we evaluate the behavior of umbilical cord mesenchymal stromal cells (UC-MSCs), labeled with fluorescent nanoparticles, transplanted in healthy or early symptomatic transgenic SOD1G93A mice (a murine model of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis). The double labeling of cells with nanoparticles and Hoechst-33258 enabled their tracking for a long time in both cells and tissues. Whole-body distribution of UC-MSCs was performed by in-vivo and ex-vivo analyses 1, 7, 21. days after single intravenous or intracerebroventricular administration. By intravenous administration cells were sequestered by the lungs and rapidly cleared by the liver. No difference in biodistribution was found among the two groups. On the other hand, UC-MSCs transplanted in lateral ventricles remained on the choroid plexus for the whole duration of the study even if decreasing in number. Few cells were found in the spinal cord of SOD1G93A mice exclusively. No migration in brain parenchyma was observed. These results suggest that the direct implantation in brain ventricles allows a prolonged permanence of cells close to the damaged areas and makes this method of tracking reliable for future studies of efficacy."

  abstract: "Efficient application of stem cells to the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases requires safe cell tracking to follow stem cell fate over time in the host environment after transplantation. In this work, for the first time, fluorescent and biocompatible methyl methacrylate (MMA)-based nanoparticles (fluoNPs) were synthesized through a free-radical co-polymerization process with a fluorescent macromonomer obtained by linking Rhodamine B and hydroxyethyl methacrylate. We demonstrate that the fluoNPs produced by polymerization of MMA-Rhodamine complexes (1) were efficient for the labeling and tracking of multipotent human amniotic fluid cells (hAFCs); (2) did not alter the main biological features of hAFCs (such as viability, cell growth and metabolic activity); (3) enabled us to determine the longitudinal bio-distribution of hAFCs in different brain areas after graft in the brain ventricles of healthy mice by a direct fluorescence-based technique. The reliability of our approach was furthermore confirmed by magnetic resonance imaging analyses, carried out by incubating hAFCs with both superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles and fluoNPs. Our data suggest that these finely tunable and biocompatible fluoNPs can be exploited for the longitudinal tracking of stem cells. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd."

  abstract: "The reactivity of gas phase radicals generated during the MOCVD of GaAs, GaN, ZnS, ZnSe, and CdTe was studied using density functional theory. Calculations were performed with B3LYP functionals and different basis sets. It was found that the production of CH3 through surface reactions is an intrinsic part of the growth process when using Ga(CH3)3, Zn(CH3)2, or Cd(CH3)2 as gas phase precursors. After being generated, CH3 can react with the organometallic molecules or with H2, if it is used as carrier gas, to give CH4 and H. Atomic hydrogen is much more reactive than CH 3 and can easily decompose Ga(CH3)3 and Cd(CH3)2 to GaCH3 and CdCH3, which leads to an increase of the film growth rate. When reacting with H 2Se, H can start a radical chain mechanism that can eventually determine the formation of large ZnSe gas phase adducts. Finally, it was found that H can react with NH3 to give NH2, which can then react with Ga(CH3)3 to give Ga(CH3) 2NH2 and successively form GaN gas phase adducts. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The radical reactions were studied using the Density Functional Theory. All calculations were performed with B3LYP functionals and in particular the 6-31G(d,p) basis set was selected to evaluate the exchange and correlation energies. The computational method was first validated by predicting the rate constant of the propagation step and comparing the calculated values to experimental ones. Then intramolecular chain transfer, β-scission and branching reactions were also investigated, due to their direct connection with the production of defects in the growing chains. A comparison of the evaluated kinetic constants of such secondary reactions with other computational evaluations and experimental data was finally made. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

  abstract: "Studies of cellular internalization of nanoparticles (NPs) play a paramount role for the design of efficient drug delivery systems, but so far they lack a robust experimental technique able to quantify the NP uptake in terms of number of NPs internalized in each cell. In this work we propose a novel method which provides a quantitative evaluation of fluorescent NP uptake by combining flow cytometry and plate fluorimetry with measurements of number of cells. Single cell fluorescence signals measured by flow cytometry were associated with the number of internalized NPs, exploiting the observed linearity between average flow cytometric fluorescence and overall plate fluorimeter measures, and previous calibration of the microplate reader with serial dilutions of NPs. This precise calibration has been made possible by using biocompatible fluorescent NPs in the range of 20-300 nm with a narrow particle size distribution, functionalized with a covalently bonded dye, Rhodamine B, and synthesized via emulsion free-radical polymerization. We report the absolute number of NPs internalized in mouse mammary tumor cells (4T1) as a function of time for different NP dimensions and surface charges and at several exposure concentrations. The obtained results indicate that 4T1 cells incorporated 103-104 polymer NPs in a short time, reaching an intracellular concentration 15 times higher than the external one. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd."

  abstract: "Biodegradable polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) are attracting increasing attention as carriers for drug delivery. However, one of the main factors limiting their transition to the market is their premature degradation and release of the payload during the storage. Therefore, for increasing the formulation shelf-life, the removal of water is of paramount importance. In this work, we synthesized both polyethylene glycol (PEG)-stabilized and zwitterionic NPs via Reversible Addition Fragmentation Chain Transfer (RAFT) Polymerization. We demonstrated that lyophilization leads the PEGylated NPs to irreversible aggregation, while the stability of the zwitterionic NPs was preserved only using a cryoprotectant. Therefore, we developed an alternative method for the NP concentration, based on the dialysis against a concentrated PEG solution. This method was optimized in terms of concentration factor (Fc), the ratio between the final and initial NP concentration, by acting on the PEG concentration in the dialysis medium, on its volume and on the initial NP concentration. With this approach, Fc up to 40 can be achieved in less than 10 h, preserving the possibility of redispersing the NPs to their original particle size distribution. Therefore, the dialysis proposed herein is a valuable alternative to lyophilization for the concentration of polymer NPs preserving their stability."

  abstract: "Synthetic substrates able to prevent the adhesion of cells, commonly referred to as nonfouling surfaces, are useful in a wide range of applications, including the culture of multicellular spheroids and the engineering of complex cell sheets. Nonfouling properties are commonly conferred to surfaces through superhydrophilic polymer-based coatings. At the same time, this type of treatment requires difficult, expensive, and time-consuming procedures, leading to high prices of the final product. In this perspective, the development of quick single-step methods to coat surfaces with nonfouling polymers would dramatically reduce the costs and increase the flexibility of such products. Moreover, this strategy would enable the process to be carried out directly by the end user. In this work, we report a fast and easy-to-use coating method to prevent the nonspecific adhesion of cells on tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS) surfaces. Our approach is based on the adsorption of poly(styrene-co-3-sulfopropyl methacrylate) copolymers comprising nonfouling hydrophilic moieties as well as functionalities that enhance the polymer adhesion to the substrate. The polymer adsorption is obtained from an aqueous mixture with a procedure that can be conveniently performed in short time. The kinetic of polymer adsorption as well as the effect of the polymer concentration was studied in order to reduce the time and cost of the entire procedure. Additionally, the polymer composition and the polymer density were optimized to completely avoid the adhesion of three different adherent cell lines, that is, CHO, A375-P, and HFF-1 cells."

  abstract: "Many efforts have been performed in order to understand the role of recruited macrophages in the progression of spinal cord injury (SCI). Different studies revealed a pleiotropic effect played by these cells associated to distinct phenotypes (M1 and M2), showing a predictable spatial and temporal distribution in the injured site after SCI. Differently, the role of activated microglia in injury progression has been poorly investigated, mainly because of the challenges to target and selectively modulate them in situ. A delivery nanovector tool (poly-ε-caprolactone-based nanoparticles) able to selectively treat/target microglia has been developed and used here to clarify the temporal and spatial involvement of the pro-inflammatory response associated to microglial cells in SCI. We show that a treatment with nanoparticles loaded with minocycline, the latter a well-known anti-inflammatory drug, when administered acutely in a SCI mouse model is able to efficiently modulate the resident microglial cells reducing the pro-inflammatory response, maintaining a pro-regenerative milieu and ameliorating the behavioral outcome up to 63 days post injury. Furthermore, by using this selective delivery tool we demonstrate a mechanistic link between early microglia activation and M1 macrophages recruitment to the injured site via CCL2 chemokine, revealing a detrimental contribution of pro-inflammatory macrophages to injury progression after SCI."

  abstract: "The free-radical polymerization (FRP) kinetics for n-butyl cyanoacrylate (BCA) and methyl methacrylate (MMA) copolymerization are studied in bulk at 30-70 °C using both a pulsed-laser polymerization technique and Quantum Mechanics (QM). Through the addition of 1 v% dichloroacetic acid, the notoriously rapid anionic polymerization of alkyl-cyanoacrylates (ACA) is successfully suppressed without affecting the FRP process. A strongly alternating copolymer sequence distribution is confirmed by reactivity ratio estimates determined using 1H-NMR composition analysis (rBCA = 0.236 ± 0.042 and rMMA = 0.057 ± 0.008), in excellent agreement with QM predictions (rBCA = 0.272 and rMMA = 0.057) made at 50 °C. For MMA-rich monomer mixtures (0.50 ≤ fMMA ≤ 0.97), overall propagation rate coefficients (kp,cop) greater than twice the value for MMA homopolymerization (kp,MMA) are facilitated by the strongly alternating copolymerization kinetics, whereas the BCA propagation rate coefficient (kp,BCA) is estimated to be only 336 ± 20 L mol-1 s-1 at 50 °C, approximately half the value of kp,MMA. These detailed results renew our understanding of the FRP kinetics for this class of monomer, important to adhesive and biomedical applications, and illustrate that an extensive and otherwise inaccessible (via anionic polymerization) level of control can be achieved over poly(ACA) final properties.

Activation of microglia/macrophages and the associated inflammatory response appears to be a self-propelling mechanism that leads to progressive neurodegeneration and development of persisting pain state. Recent advances in polymer science have provided a huge amount of innovations leading to increased interest for polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) as drug delivery tools to treat SCI. In this study, we tested and evaluated in vitro and in vivo a new drug delivery nanocarrier: minocycline loaded in NPs composed by a polymer based on poly-ε-caprolactone and polyethylene glycol. These NPs are able to selectively target and modulate, specifically, the activated proinflammatory microglia/macrophages in subacute progression of the secondary injury in SCI mouse model. After minocycline-NPs treatment, we demonstrate a reduced activation and proliferation of microglia/macrophages around the lesion site and a reduction of cells with round shape phagocytic-like phenotype in favor of a more arborized resting-like phenotype with low CD68 staining. Treatment here proposed limits, up to 15 days tested, the proinflammatory stimulus associated with microglia/macrophage activation. This was demonstrated by reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and persistent reduced expression of CD68 in traumatized site. The nanocarrier drug delivery tool developed here shows potential advantages over the conventionally administered anti-inflammatory therapy, maximizing therapeutic efficiency and reducing side effects. © 2013 American Chemical Society."

  abstract: "The possibility to control the fate of the cells responsible for secondary mechanisms following spinal cord injury (SCI) is one of the most relevant challenges to reduce the post traumatic degeneration of the spinal cord. In particular, microglia/macrophages associated inflammation appears to be a self-propelling mechanism which leads to progressive neurodegeneration and development of persisting pain state. In this study we analyzed the interactions between poly(methyl methacrylate) nanoparticles (PMMA-NPs) and microglia/macrophages in vitro and in vivo, characterizing the features that influence their internalization and ability to deliver drugs. The uptake mechanisms of PMMA-NPs were in-depth investigated, together with their possible toxic effects on microglia/macrophages. In addition, the possibility to deliver a mimetic drug within microglia/macrophages was characterized in vitro and in vivo. Drug-loaded polymeric NPs resulted to be a promising tool for the selective administration of pharmacological compounds in activated microglia/macrophages and thus potentially able to counteract relevant secondary inflammatory events in SCI. © 2013 Elsevier B.V."

  abstract: "Several difficulties are reported in literature about the experimental analysis of polymerizations involving 2-hydroxyethyl acrylate (HEA), mainly due to transfer reactions that characterize the system. In particular, major problems are emerged in the study of free radical copolymerization kinetics of HEA. In this work, free-radical copolymerization propagation kinetics of HEA and styrene (ST) are investigated through a computational approach based on density functional theory. Monomer reactivity ratios for HEA/ST copolymerization are calculated at 50°C and 125°C, obtaining values that exhibit a weak dependence on temperature. In particular, HEA reactivity ratio, rHEA, equal to 0.14 and ST reactivity ratio, rST, equal to 0.31 at 50°C, whereas rHEA = 0.17 and rST = 0.29 at 125°C. Moreover, the reliability of such parameters has been tested by analyzing copolymer composition data as a function of monomer feed composition, at the same temperatures indicated above. Experimental values proposed in literature are well predicted by the terminal copolymerization model using the kinetic parameters computationally determined. POLYM. ENG.

  abstract: "Stem cell therapy is considered a promising approach in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) seem to be the most effective in ALS animal models. The umbilical cord (UC) is a source of highly proliferating fetal MSCs, more easily collectable than other MSCs. Recently we demonstrated that human (h) UC-MSCs, double labeled with fluorescent nanoparticles and Hoechst-33258 and transplanted intracerebroventricularly (ICV) into SOD1G93A transgenic mice, partially migrated into the spinal cord after a single injection. This prompted us to assess the effect of repeated ICV injections of hUC-MSCs on disease progression in SOD1G93A mice. Although no transplanted cells migrated to the spinal cord, a partial but significant protection of motor neurons (MNs) was found in the lumbar spinal cord of hUC-MSCs-treated SOD1G93A mice, accompanied by a shift from a pro-inflammatory (IL-6, IL-1β) to anti-inflammatory (IL-4, IL-10) and neuroprotective (IGF-1) environment in the lumbar spinal cord, probably linked to the activation of p-Akt survival pathway in both motor neurons and reactive astrocytes. However, this treatment neither prevented the muscle denervation nor delayed the disease progression of mice, emphasizing the growing evidence that protecting the motor neuron perikarya is not sufficient to delay the ALS progression."

  abstract: "Free-radical polymerization of vinyl chloride is investigated computationally with special attention to the secondary reactions involving mid-chain radicals (MCRs). Namely, the rate constants of backbiting, chain scission, chain transfer, and propagation reactions are evaluated using a density functional theory method. The rate coefficients of such reactions are estimated taking into account the position of the radical along the chain as well as its distance from the chain-end. In particular 1:5, 5:1, and 5:9 backbiting are the most relevant secondary reactions, followed by the slower propagation of MCRs. Finally, a kinetic model of suspension polymerization including the investigated reactions is developed, in order to determine their impact on the quality of the final polymer. Vinyl chloride polymerization is investigated using quantum chemical methods, with emphasis on the reactions involving MCRs. A kinetic model accounting for such reactions is developed to elucidate their impact on the final polymer properties. The contribution of backbiting reactions is relevant in determining the radical migration along the chains. Copyright © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim."

In this work Quantum Chemistry was employed to investigate gas phase polymerization of chlorosilanes in operating conditions proper to silicon epitaxy.

In particular, a large number of linear, branched and cyclic silicon- compounds were analyzed (up to Si6Clx species). Finally the kinetic scheme was embedded in a reactor simulation code, where significant amounts of such species were obtained."

  abstract: "An optimal drug delivery system should be characterized by biocompatibility, biodegradability, high drug loading and favorable drug release profile. To achieve this goal a hydrazone linked doxorubicin-poly(lactic acid) prodrug (PLA-DOX) was synthesized by the functionalization of a short polymer chain produced by ring opening polymerization. The hydrophobic prodrug generated in this way was nanoprecipitated using a block copolymer to form polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) with a quantitative loading efficiency and a high and tunable drug loading. The effects of the concentration of the PLA-DOX prodrug and surfactant were studied by dynamic light scattering showing a range of NP size between 50 and 90 nm and monodispersed size distributions with polydispersity indexes lower then 0.27 up to a maximum DOX concentration of 27% w/w. The release profile of DOX from these NPs, tested at different pH conditions, showed a higher release rate in acidic conditions, consistent with the nature of the hydrazone bond which was used to conjugate the drug to the polymer. In vitro cytotoxicity studies performed on BV2 microglia-like cell line highlighted a specific cytotoxic effect of these NPs suggesting the maintenance of the drug efficacy and a modified release profile upon encapsulation of DOX in the NPs.

  abstract: "This chapter discusses the reaction mechanism in order to explain the significant differences in selectivity with respect to the epoxidation by peracids and provides preliminary successful results in the synthesis of propylene oxide. The combination of N-hydroxyphthalimide (NHPI) and peracids is employed for the free-radical epoxidation of alkenes with high yields. A quite different selectivity is obtained from that of the well-known epoxidation by peracids, which is attributed to a different reaction mechanism and which evidences the molecule-induced homolysis of NHPI by peracids and dioxiranes. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and thermodynamic studies, as well as the marked solvent effect and the high selectivity in the a-position, strongly support the mechanistic interpretation. The in situ generation of acyl peroxyl radicals from acetaldehyde and molecular oxygen and the optimization of the reaction conditions allow the development of an innovative process for the convenient metal-free synthesis of several epoxides, suggesting an intriguing alternative route to the production of propylene oxide. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract: "Small interfering RNA (siRNA) is receiving increasing attention with regard to the treatment of many genetic diseases, both acquired and hereditary, such as cancer and diabetes. Being a high molecular weight (MW) polyanion, siRNA is not able to cross a cell membrane, and in addition it is unstable in physiological conditions. Accordingly, a biocompatible nanocarrier able to deliver siRNA into cells is needed. In this work, we synthesized biocompatible positively charged nanoparticles (NPs) following a two-step process that involves ring opening polymerization (ROP) and emulsion free radical polymerization (EFRP). Firstly, we proved the possibility of fine tuning the NPs' characteristics (e.g. size and surface charge) by changing the synthetic process parameters. Then the capability in loading and delivering undamaged siRNA into a cancer cell cytoplasm has been shown. This latter process occurs through the biodegradation of the polymer constituting the NPs, whose kinetics can be tuned by adjusting the polymer's MW. Finally, the ability of NPs to carry siRNA inside the cells in order to inhibit their target gene has been demonstrated using green flourescent protein positive cells."

  abstract: "Cell metabolism is a key determinant factor for the pluripotency and fate commitment of Stem Cells (SCs) during development, ageing, pathological onset and progression. We derived and cultured selected subpopulations of rodent fetal, postnatal, adult Neural SCs (NSCs) and postnatal glial progenitors, Olfactory Ensheathing Cells (OECs), respectively from the subventricular zone (SVZ) and the olfactory bulb (OB). Cell lysates were analyzed by proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy leading to metabolites identification and quantitation. Subsequent multivariate analysis of NMR data by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Partial Least Square Discriminant Analysis (PLS-DA) allowed data reduction and cluster analysis. This strategy ensures the definition of specific features in the metabolic content of phenotypically similar SCs sharing a common developmental origin. The metabolic fingerprints for selective metabolites or for the whole spectra demonstrated enhanced peculiarities among cell types. The key result of our work is a neat divergence between OECs and the remaining NSC cells. We also show that statistically significant differences for selective metabolites characterizes NSCs of different ages. Finally, the retrived metabolome in cell cultures correlates to the physiological SC features, thus allowing an integrated bioengineering approach for biologic fingerprints able to dissect the (neural) SC molecular specificities."

  abstract: "The biodiesel industry has grown rapidly in the last years, leading to the production of 88 000 tons of waste glycerol in 2018. Glycerol is a bio-derived molecule already exploited in pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries for its beneficial emollient and antimicrobial properties, safety and low cost. However, since its production is increasing year by year, many efforts are being done to find new ways to exploit it and to produce new valuable bio-based molecules. In particular, glycerol carbonate is a versatile molecule that can be produced from glycerol and another waste product, CO2. Despite its potentialities in further functionalization, harsh reaction conditions are often required for the synthesis of glycerol carbonate and its exploitation is often challenging. Therefore, an industrially scalable reaction to convert glycerol into high added-value compounds is urgently needed. Here, the aim is to demonstrate a feasible conversion of glycerol to glycerol carbonate-based vinyl monomers that can be conveniently incorporated in amphiphilic block copolymers by reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. These block copolymers can be self-assembled in water to obtain nanoparticles with a bio-based content as high as 70% w/w. Since both glycerol and glycerol carbonate are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and considered as safe, the possibility of exploiting these bio-based nanoparticles for the controlled drug release was explored."

The reactivity ratios for this system are near unity, while a linear relationship between kp,cop, the copolymer-averaged propagation rate coefficient, and the composition of macromonomer in the feed (0-80wt% range) is determined. At 50wt% macromonomer in the feed, a 1.67±0.02 and 1.64±0.06 increase in kp,cop/kp,MMA is determined for HEMA-CL3 and HEMA-CL2, respectively. These macromonomers are adopted to synthesize nanoparticles (NPs) in the range of 100-150nm through batch emulsion free radical polymerization (BEP) to produce partially degradable drug delivery carriers. The produced NPs are tested in 4T1 cell line and show excellent characteristics as carriers: they do not affect cell proliferation, and a relevant number of NPs, thousands per cell, are internalized. Radical copolymerization kinetics of MMA and HEMA-CLn are studied using the PLP-SEC technique. The potential bioapplication of the system is investigated through the synthesis of copolymer NPs by emulsion polymerization.

NP size, surface charge, and chemistry can be controlled via the adoption of different macromolecular transfer agents produced via RAFT polymerization of amphiphilic monomers. Thanks to this versatility, interparticle interactions can be easily tuned by changing solvent composition and temperature. In addition, the refractive index and density of the solvent can simultaneously match those of the NPs by adding sodium polytungstate, an organic salt widely used for density gradient centrifugation.

While propagation rate coefficients (kp) determined by pulsed laser polymerization experiments for bulk PLA1EMA and PLA5EMA are not significantly different over the 40-100 °C temperature range, they are elevated by 60% compared to methyl methacrylate, indicating that the nature of substituents several units beyond the methacrylic group does not decisively impact bulk kp measurements. Compared to bulk PLA5EMA, the apparent kp in 75 wt% n-butanol solution is enhanced due to hydrogen bonding, whereas in 75 wt% dimethylformamide solution it is reduced by 35% because of differences in macromonomer and solvent molar volumes. The PLA5EMA macromonomers are used to produce nanoparticles (NP) by emulsion radical polymerization that degrade almost four times more slowly than NPs produced from their hydroxyl terminated macromonomer counterpart."

  abstract: "Summary: In this work one-pot synthesis of PEGylated PLA-based nanoparticles (NPs) without using any surfactant has been performed. Adopting ring opening polymerization of L,L-Lactide and 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA), vinyl end functionalized poly(lactic acid) macromonomers (HEMA-LA n) have been produced with tunable number of lactic acid units (larger than 5) and a low molecular weight distribution. Macromonomers have been further copolymerized with modified PEG chains (HEMA-PEGm) through a monomer starved semi-batch emulsion polymerization performed without using any surfactant. In these conditions, small and monodispersed NPs of around 150 nm are obtained. Since macromonomers with n larger than 5 are highly viscous at room temperature, they have to be dissolved in a solvent before their injection in the reactor. In this work the effects in changing the solvent adopted in the starved process (water miscible or non-miscible) and its amount have been investigated. Moreover, the effect of both PEG chains concentration and MW on the final NPs properties has been elucidated. The colloidal stability of the NPs produced using different solvents has been verified in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution via dynamic light scattering measurements; in addition the critical coagulation concentration of these PEGylated NPs has been determined.

  abstract: "Polymer nanoparticles (NPs) have recently attracted increasing attention and represent one of the main and important novelties in nanomedicine. In particular, they exhibit several advantages like the ability to tailor and sustain the release of hydrophobic drugs, high biocompatibility and degradability, together with the possibility to be highly cell selective. However, the usage of NPs in several diseases can be limited by their route of administration: in fact their diffuse distribution in tissues and organs does not allow to address them specifically in the target situ limiting therapeutic outcome and increasing potential side effects. In this work we studied the self-assembly of opposite charged polymer nanoparticles able to retain aqueous solutions, with the aim of creating self-assembled macrostructures that can release both hydrophobic and hydrophilic compounds. NPs were synthesized with a two-steps process starting from ε-caprolactone and hydroxyethyl methacrylate to create biodegradable macromonomers which were then co-polymerized in an emulsion polymerization with methacrylic acid and either a positive charged surfmer (HEMA-Ch<sup>+</sup>) or a negative one (HEMA-SO<inf>3</inf><sup>-</sup>). The feasibility to assemble these NPs into macrostructures was studied and the structures of the final products as well as their ability to release mimetic drugs were evaluated."

  abstract: "Thermo-responsive polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) are emerging as a powerful tool in nanomedicine for the fabrication of advanced drug delivery systems. In addition to their size and biodegradation rate, phase separation of NPs upon application of a thermal stimulus provides an additional switch to control the rate of release of active components. Among the materials currently developed for biomedical applications, NPs stabilized by zwitterionic polymers are gaining increasing interest due to their high stability and ability to escape the body immune response. Yet, biodegradable zwitterionic NPs with temperature response under physiological conditions are currently not available. Here, we develop a new class of biodegradable zwitterionic NPs that exhibit UCST phase transition in the biological temperature range (T = 30-45 °C) and in physiological solution (i.e. 0.9% w/w NaCl). We design a strategy that relies on the self-assembly of block copolymers produced via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) emulsion polymerization. These copolymers comprise a zwitterionic portion exhibiting an upper critical solution temperature (UCST) and a biodegradable hydrophobic block consisting of oligoesters functionalized with a vinyl group. This modular macromolecular architecture allows us to independently control a variety of NP properties by modifying the individual components of the copolymer. In particular, the zwitterionic block of the copolymers controls the UCST-type phase separation behavior, while the number of the oligoester repeating units governs the size of the NPs and the length of the oligoester dictates the degradation rate. After demonstrating the synthesis of highly controlled degradable NPs, we show the potential of this new class of materials in the context of drug delivery by controlling the release of a drug-mimic molecule upon temperature variations in a broad time range from few minutes to 20 hours."

  abstract: "Synthetic polymers are attracting growing attention as additives for laundry and personal care products. In particular, the high volatility of many common fragrances requires the development of polymeric particles for their encapsulation and controlled release. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these carriers is made from polymers that are not biodegradable. This poses severe concerns about the accumulation of nano- and microplastics. Hence, such particles are expected to be banned from the market in the coming years. Therefore, biodegradable particles enabling a long-lasting release of the fragrances are urgently needed. In this work, we produced biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) that are structurally composed of lactones, i.e. well known perfumes that occur naturally and that are already considered safe by regulatory agencies. We polymerized these lactones via ring opening polymerization (ROP) using an ionizable tertiary amine as initiator to produce in a single step amphiphilic oligoesters able to directly self-assemble into NPs once nanoprecipitated in water. In this way, we can produce biodegradable NPs with a perfume loading up to 85 % w/w without the need for additional surfactants. Subsequently we show that the ionizable group is able to confer a positive charge to our nanoparticles and, in turn, a high adsorption capacity on natural fibers (i.e. hairs and cotton fabric). Finally, we demonstrate the nanoparticle resistance to rinsing and their ability to confer a long-lasting fragrance perception to treated hair swatches for at least 3 weeks."

Reactions have been carried out in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO2) at different temperatures, ranging from 90 to 130 °C. The resulting oligomers have been characterized by different techniques ( 1H-NMR, 13CNMR, MALDI-TOF, ESI, GPC, FT-IR, TGA), which show that oligomers with narrower molecular weight distribution are produced at the lowest temperature. In addition, a significant reduction of the impact of the secondary reactions has been found at this same temperature (90 °C), leading to a crude product with enhanced purity. Finally, the synthesized macromonomers have been used to produce NPs whose degradation behaviour has been investigated. An improved control of the degradation rate is observed for the NPs synthesized using the macromonomer produced in scCO2 at 90 °C. This journal is © the Partner Organisations 2014."

  abstract: "Ibuprofen (IBU) is a widespread drug used to treat both acute and chronic disorders. It is generally taken orally but the free drug can induce the irritation of the gastric mucosa due to its acid nature. In literature, different approaches have been adopted to prevent the release in the stomach, such as physical entrapment with film-coated tablets and drug-conjugates. Nevertheless, these solutions have many disadvantages, including the fast release of the drug and the difficulty to swallow the tablet, especially for children who may vomit or refuse the tablet. For this reason, in this work, novel formulations are proposed that do not require the encapsulation of the drug into a solid form and, in turn, their assumption as a pill. IBU has been linked to different types of methacrylates via ester bond in order to produce pH-responsive macromolecular monomers. The novelty is related to the use of these drug-conjugates macromonomer for the production of nanoparticles (NPs) via emulsion polymerization (EP), using water as solvent. The final emulsion is able to load up to 30 mg ml-1 of IBU, so less than 10 ml is required to be assumed to reach the minimum therapeutic dose of the drug (200 mg). Finally, the release of IBU from these novel drinkable formulations has been investigated in the gastric and intestinal simulated fluids to show the preferential release of IBU from the NPs in basic conditions. A comparison with an existing oral suspension has been performed to highlight the slower release in acid environment of these new formulations. Afterwards, the IBU loaded NPs were tested in vitro showing lower toxicity compared to the free drug."

Computational studies were conducted to assess the FRP kinetics of each binary copolymerization between vinylidene fluoride (VDF), hexafluoropropylene (HFP), and tetrafluoroethylene (TFE). More specifically, all calculations were performed using density functional theory (DFT), and the B3LYP level of theory was used to optimize structures and determine absolute minimum energy geometries, whereas the electronic energies were estimated using B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) as well as a higher level of theory, MPWB1K/6-31G(d,p). Transition state theory was employed to determine kinetic parameters according to the terminal model of copolymerization. The homopolymerization of VDF and all of its corresponding copolymerizations were investigated by taking into account every possible propagation reaction (head to head, head to tail, tail to tail, head to monomer, tail to monomer, etc.) to estimate the Arrhenius parameters for each system. This study provides the estimation of a large set of rate coefficients, which gives detailed pictures of the specific copolymerization systems examined and is highly valuable to generate a comprehensive overview of the polymerization kinetics of relevant fluorinated monomers. © 2013 American Chemical Society."

  abstract: "Nanoclusters (NCs) composed of nanoparticles (NPs) with different functionalities and having final size in the sub-micrometer range are of great interest for biomedical imaging, drug delivery, sensors, etc. Because some of the functionalities cannot be incorporated into a single NP, e.g., high drug loading combined with strong magnetic properties, here, we present a proof of the concept using an alternative way to combine these properties using different NPs. In particular, starting from polymer and magnetite nanoparticles (MNPs), we produce NCs made out of a statistical distribution of the two components through a process based on aggregation and breakup. The effect of all involved operating parameters, i.e., primary NP size and composition, surfactant type and concentration, and applied hydrodynamic stress on the NC size and internal structure, was systematically investigated using dynamic light scattering (DLS), static light scattering (SLS), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analyses. It was found that, by properly tuning the balance between attractive and steric repulsive forces on one side and hydrodynamic stress on the other, NCs as small as 100 nm can be produced. In all cases, the produced NCs have a very compact internal structure characterized by fractal dimension around 2.6. The proposed production strategy to synthesize hetero-NCs composed of mixtures of various primary particles is suitable for the production of multifunctional devices of nanometer size (i.e., approximately 100 nm) for material and biomedical applications. © 2014 American Chemical Society."

In this study, an HPMA modification was proposed, which leads to lipophilic nanoparticle (NP) production. Ring opening polymerization of HPMA with lactide (LT) was performed to obtain reactive HPMA-LAn macromonomers with different average chain lengths. The HPMA modification produced lipophilic macromonomer starting materials that were subsequently used to obtain polymer nanoparticles that are suitable for drug delivery applications of hydrophobic drugs. Different strategies were explored. First, emulsion-free radical polymerization was conducted to obtain the monodispersed PEGylated polymer NPs. Next, solvent polymerization was performed to produce a poly(HPMA-LAn)-based polymer solution, which was used to produce the NPs via flash nanoprecipitation. Because these NPs are designed for drug delivery applications, their fast degradability in a biological medium was verified. Additionally, the ability to load and release a drug (i.e., dexamethasone) was verified for the NPs, which were synthesized using the proposed strategies, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the HPMA functionalization to obtain a system for delivering lipophilic drugs."

In acrylate polymerization, the presence of a relatively large amount of midchain radicals (MCRs) opens the way for alternative kinetic pathways involving CTAs, which can result in a modification of the overall kinetics as well as the final polymer properties. In this work, chain transfer reactions from butyl acrylate (BA) radicals of various size and nature to a set of selected CTAs are investigated using quantum chemistry. The different reactivity of chain-end and midchain radicals is emphasized, with particular focus on the kinetic effect of the radical chain length. Eventually, the mechanism of MCR patching and its relevance in decreasing the branching density are critically examined, with reference to the estimated kinetic parameters and experimental evidence about BA polymerization. © 2013 American Chemical Society."

  abstract: "Cell-selective drug release in the central nervous system (CNS) holds great promise for the treatment of many CNS disorders but it is still challenging. We previously demonstrated that polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) injected intra-parenchyma in the CNS can be internalized specifically in microglia/macrophages surrounding the injection site. Here, we explored NPs administration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to achieve a wider spreading and increased cell targeting throughout the CNS; we generated new NPs variants and studied the effect of modifying size and surface charge on NPs biodistribution and cellular uptake. Intra-cerebroventricular administration resulted in prevalent localization of the NPs in proximity to stem-cell niches, such as around the lateral ventricles, the subventricular zone and the rostral migratory stream. NPs internalization occurred preferentially in brain myeloid cells/microglia. We demonstrated that brain biodistribution and extent of internalization in microglia are influenced by NPs dimensions and can be improved by applying a transient disruption of the blood-brain barrier with mannitol, leading to NPs internalization in up to 25% of brain myeloid/microglia cells. A fraction of the targeted cells was positive for markers of proliferation or stained positive for stemness/progenitor-cell markers such as Nestin, c-kit, or NG2. Interestingly, through these newly formulated NPs we obtained controlled and selective release of drugs otherwise difficult to formulate (such as busulfan and etoposide) to the target cells, preventing unwanted side effects and the toxicity obtained by direct brain delivery of the not encapsulated drugs. Overall, these data provide proof of concept of the applicability of these novel NP-based drug formulations for achieving internalization not only in mature microglia but also possibly in more immature myeloid cells in the brain and pave the way for brain-restricted microglia-targeted drug delivery regimens."

Macromonomers were characterized through SEC, NMR, and FTIR and are subsequently polymerized through monomer-starved semi-batch emulsion polymerization (MSSEP). The effect on the polymerization process of various emulsifiers on the final diameter and particle size distribution has been studied. The resulting PLA-based NPs are characterized by a narrow size distribution and a small particle size, down to 25 nm. Finally, a degradation study of selected NPs has been carried out to verify their degradability in aqueous media. It has been demonstrated the complete degradability of these PLA-based NPs which occurs upon the hydrolysis of the PLA pendant chains leaving poly-HEMA chains, which, being hydrophilic causes the NPs to dissolve in the aqueous suspension. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc."

  abstract: "Background: Within the field of resorbable devices, recent years have seen an increased demand for better reliability from drug delivery systems and resorbable polymer degradation control, causing researchers to abandon trial-and-error approaches towards model-based methods. In this context, we developed a lumped-parameters zero-order model for the degradation of resorbable polymeric drug release systems. Such a model is thought to be applicable in the design of specific devices based on the expected degradation time and drug delivery rates, as it is based on a \"shrinking core\" approach and takes into account the main physicochemical. parameters involved in polymer degradation, in drug release and in mechanical strength prediction, all independently estimated. Results: The model, based on conservation equations, leads to numerically solved ordinary differential equations, the predictions of which were verified through literature data. Data of different authors and various systems were satisfactorily matched by model predictions, thus confirming the reliability of parameter estimation procedures. Conclusion: The present model is among the very few that completely address all aspects involved in device degradation and drug delivery altogether, and thus represents a step ahead with respect to current available solutions, firmly enforcing itself into the ongoing debate on the modelling of degradation and release behaviour. © 2008 Society of Chemical Industry."

The control over NP surface chemistry, size (Dn), and molecular weight (MW) of the polymer they are made up of plays a paramount role in the optimization of their end-use performance. In this work, the theoretical basis to decouple the dependence between the NP Dn and MW has been presented, and an operative way has been demonstrated via ab initio reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) emulsion polymerization (AIREP), a \"living\" heterogeneous process that adopts RAFT macro-surfmers: macromolecular chain transfer agents (CTA) produced via RAFT polymerization of amphiliphic monomers, such as surfmers. The possibility of obtaining the desired length of the lipophilic block or the length of the whole block copolymer and the NP Dn by choosing the correct length of the RAFT macro-surfmer has been assessed. It has been discovered that a wide range of Dn and MW can be achieved, but not very big NPs with very low copolymer MW; this limit is consistent with the physical and geometric constraints of the system."

  abstract: "The global pollution caused by plastics and microplastics is stimulating intense research towards more environmentally friendly materials, preserving the remarkable application characteristics of the currently available polymers. Among these, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have been hailed as the solution to replace conventional, oil-based plastics. Given their biodegradable nature and mechanical properties, their use can be envisioned in a wide range of applications reducing the environmental footprint. Several types of processes have been proposed for their production, which can be grouped in three main classes: (i) microbiological, (ii) enzymatic and (iii) chemical processes. Given the significant amount of literature available on this topic, this review aims to critically analyse what has been proposed so far in each of these classes, with specific reference to their potential to provide bioplastics that can actually replace the currently available materials. A comparison is made, based on the following aspects: achievable molecular structures (such as molecular weight and composition distributions), raw-material and production costs and availability of large-scale production technologies. Finally, some considerations and ideas on what should be further investigated and implemented to realize the economically sustainable production of PHA are brought forward."

Poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), poly-e{open}-caprolactone (PCL), and poly(lactic acid) (PLA) based NPs with different size, hydrophobicity, surface charge, PEGylation degree, type of emulsifier and ζ potential have been produced and characterized. All the different NPs have been adopted for cellular uptake studies, leading to a precise quantification of the number of internalized NPs into a selected tumor cell line. The experiments summarize, emphasize and improve the comprehension of the influence of NPs features on the uptake efficiency. In detail, a linear relationship between uptake and both size and NP concentration independently upon other NP characteristics was found. Moreover, it was confirmed that cells are able to internalize and retain for a long time preferentially positively charged NPs. Finally, by coupling results of uptake studies with cell viability measurements, an easy and fast check to control the effectiveness of a selected polymer as drug carrier has been proposed. In particular, we observed that biodegradable PLA-based NPs with high molecular weight, non-PEGylated and positively charged PCL NPs are the better choice to maximize the uptake and minimize side effect against cells."

First, various backbiting reactions are studied by adopting a simplified molecular model suitable for treating long polymer chains. The predicted reaction kinetics suggest the possibility of a radical migration along the poly(butyl acrylate) (PBA) chain as a consequence of subsequent j:j + 4 hydrogen abstractions, which are characterized by a low activation energy. Moreover, branching propagation and β-scission reactions originating from mid-chain radicals are investigated using a complete PBA model composed of five monomer units.

  abstract: "Synthetic polyampholytes are attracting significant interest due to the possibility that they offer of combining oppositely charged repeating units in the same copolymer chain. This peculiar structure makes them appealing for the understanding of biological processes such as protein folding and DNA condensation as well as for application as pH- and salt-responsive gels. In addition, the alternation at the molecular level of charges with opposite signs holds promise in avoiding the fouling of proteins, bacteria, and marine organisms. Indeed, polymer reaction engineering assumes an important role in ensuring such charge alternation and in turn the efficacy of the polyampholyte coating. In this work, the reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) copolymerization of the electrolyte monomers 3-sulfopropyl methacrylate potassium salt (anionic, SPMAK) and [2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]trimethylammonium chloride (cationic, MADQUAT) was studied in detail to highlight the influence of both the monomer and chain transfer agent (CTA) concentrations on the polymerization rate and copolymer composition. By analysing the residual monomer mixture composition via in situ nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR), the reactivity ratios for the two monomers were calculated. Interestingly, the values obtained in the case of RAFT copolymerization (i.e. r SPMAK = 0.51 ± 0.03 and r MADQUAT = 0.31 ± 0.03) are valid in the case of a conventional free-radical copolymerization under similar conditions. The optimized polyampholytes showed interesting aqueous properties, including an upper critical solution temperature (UCST), which was studied as a function of the salt concentration and polymer molecular weight. Finally, as a proof of concept, the efficacy of the synthesized polyampholytes as nonfouling coatings was assessed in the case of A375-P cells."

However, sometimes, the ability to maintain NPs localized at the site of the injection that work as a drug reservoir can represent a good and complementary option. In this direction we built a composite material made of polymeric hydrogel functionalized with polymer NPs. -caprolactone and polyethylene glycol have been copolymerized in a two-step synthesis of PEGylated NPs, while hydrogel was synthesized through polycondensation between NPs, agarose and branched polyacrylic acid. NP functionalization was verified with Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), high resolution magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance (HRMAS-NMR) spectroscopy and release kinetics from a hydrogel matrix and compared with NPs only physically entrapped into a hydrogel matrix. The characteristics of the resulting composite hydrogel-NPs system were studied both in terms of rheological properties and in its ability to sustain the release of To-Pro3, used as a drug mimetic compound to represent a promising drug delivery device."

  abstract: "Positively charged polymers have increased in importance in the last years because of the possibility of being used in many different applications, from gene delivery to polymer flooding applications and as flocculants in wastewater treatment. In all cases, the possibility of obtaining biodegradable colloidal products leads to great advantages. In this work, positively charged nanoparticles (NPs) have been produced via free radical emulsion polymerization (FREP). This synthetic route was selected since it is widely used in industry and it facilitates large scale production along with control of some key features of the final NPs such as their size, surface charge, and particle size distribution dispersity. NP synthesis was carried out by a four-step process: the synthesis of biodegradable ester-based macromonomers obtained through the ring-opening polymerization of the ε-caprolactone, the reaction among the obtained macromonomer and succinic anhydride, the final condensation with choline chloride to obtain the positively charged macromonomer, and the FREP polymerization of the produced macromonomer. The effects of reaction conditions on NP characteristics were studied, and the tunable behavior of the obtained charged NPs has been proven, also in terms of degradation time."

They are commonly synthesized via ring opening polymerization (ROP) with metal-based catalysts, but as high temperatures are needed and the products contain metal, organocatalysts are now widely adopted to polymerize them at room temperature while also ensuring short reaction times. Here, 1,7,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]-dec-5-ene is used to polymerize less reactive but renewably-derived lactones, namely δ-decalactone and δ-dodecalactone. These monomers were chosen in the attempt of creating renewable and highly lipophilic materials for drug delivery applications as alternatives to the more traditional, but non-renewable δ-valerolactone and ɛ-caprolactone. A combination of ROP and living radical polymerization Reversible Addition-Fragmentation Chain Transfer is proposed here to synthesize grafted block copolymers. They are able to self-assemble in water, forming micelles where the lipophilic polyester core is able to entrap a lipophilic drug, thus making the system a good candidate for drug delivery. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

  abstract: "Recently, a growing amount of attention has been focused on the influence of secondary reactions on the free radical polymerization features and the properties and microstructure of the final polymer, particularly in the context of acrylate copolymers. One of the most challenging aspects of this research is the accurate determination of the corresponding reaction kinetics. In this paper, this problem is addressed using quantum chemistry. The reaction rate coefficients of various backbiting, propagation, and β-scission steps are estimated considering different chain configurations of a terpolymer system composed of methyl acrylate, styrene, and methyl methacrylate. The replacement of methyl acrylate radical units with styrene and methyl methacrylate globally decreases the backbiting probability and shifts the equilibrium toward the reactants, while the effect of replacing adjacent units is weaker and more dependent upon the specific substituting monomer. Propagation kinetics is affected primarily by the replacement of the radical units, while this effect appears to be particularly effective on midchain radical reactivity. The overall results clarify the different physicochemical behavior of chain-end, midchain, and short-branch radicals as a function of copolymer composition, providing new insights into free radical polymerization kinetics. © 2013 American Chemical Society."

Mechanisms and reaction paths involved in the free radical polymerization of widely used monomers are studied through a computational approach based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). First, the attention is focused on the initiation kinetics in order to evaluate the role of the initiators in the polymerization process. Methyl acrylate, methyl methacrylate, acrylonitrile, and styrene homopolymerization using different initiators are studied. Then, propagation kinetics is investigated. In particular, the propagation kinetic rate constants for different kinds of acrylates, methacrylates and acetates are calculated and compared with experimental data reported in the literature. The same computational approach is applied to the study of secondary reactions (backbiting, beta-scission) occurring during free radical polymerizations. Finally, the same methodologies are applied to copolymer systems, with emphasis on the evaluation of the role of penultimate effect. The copolymers vinyl acetate/methyl methacrylate and styrene/methyl methacrylate are investigated as system characterized by weak and strong penultimate effect, respectively. © 2011 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

  abstract: "The architecture, composition and molecular weight (MW) of polymers and copolymers made via free radical polymerization are important parameters that affect the end-use of both these polymeric materials and the nanoparticles that they compose. In order to gain control over these parameters, several controlled radical polymerizations (CRPs)—such as atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization—have been developed over the past few decades. However, the toxicity, biocompatibility and degradation profile of these materials are emerging as key features for their final disposal and for certain applications, such as the synthesis of biomaterials. In this case, polyesters made via ring opening polymerization (ROP) are preferred due to the control over the synthesis that this technique allows as well as the biodegradability of the final material. The combination of ROP with CRP techniques has allowed for the synthesis of polymeric surfactants capable of self-assembling into biodegradable nanoparticles (NPs) for biomedical applications. This review presents and critically discusses the primary strategies for the synthesis of highly engineered colloids via the combination of ROP with two CRP techniques: ATRP and RAFT polymerization."

  abstract: "The most adopted methods to produce polymer nanoparticles (NPs) for medical and pharmaceutical applications use surfactants that are toxic and physically adsorbed to the NPs, with the risk of desorption and insurgence of side effects. A valid alternative is represented by the use of surfmers, reactive surfactants that are chemically linked to the polymer chains, thus avoiding the release of toxic species. In this case, the lack of biodegradable surfmers introduces the concern of polymer accumulation into the body. In this work, biodegradable, poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)ylated N-(2-hydroxypropyl) methacrylamide (HPMA) based surfmers are synthesized and used to stabilize lipophilic NPs. In particular, the NP core is made from a macromonomer comprising a poly(lactic acid) (PLA) chain functionalized with HPMA double bond. The NP forming polymer chains are then constituted by a uniform poly(HPMA) backbone that is biocompatible and water soluble and hydrolysable PEG and PLA pendants assuring the complete degradability of the polymer. The stability provided to these NPs by the synthesized surfmers is studied in the cases of both emulsion free radical polymerization and solution free radical polymerization followed by the flash nanoprecipitation of the obtained amphiphilic copolymers."

  abstract: "The control over the size distribution and stability of polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) is crucial in many of their applications, especially in the biomedical field. These characteristics are typically influenced by the production method and the nature of the starting material. To investigate these aspects, the controlled radical polymerization of functionalized methacrylates constituted by 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) functionalized with a controlled number of ε-caprolactone (CL) units (HEMA-CLn ), was carried out via reversible addition–fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) in solution. The living reaction allows for good control over the molar mass of the final polymer with a low molar mass dispersity. The obtained polymer solutions were nanoprecipitated in order to produce NPs suitable for drug delivery applications with narrow particle size distribution and a wide size range (from 60 to 250 nm). The NP synthesis has been performed using a mixing device, in order to control the parameters involved in the nanoprecipitation process. As already seen for similar systems, the size of the produced NPs is a function of the polymer concentration during the nanoprecipitation process. Nevertheless, when the polymer concentration is kept constant, the NP size is influenced by the chemical structure of the polymer used, in terms of the presence of PEG (poly(ethylene glycol)), the degree of RAFT polymerization, and the length of the caprolactone side chain. These characteristics were also found to influence the stability and degradation properties of the produced NPs."

  abstract: "During the last years, the field of drug delivery has experienced a growing interest toward the so-called thermo-responsive polymers: synthetic materials that, due to the specific hydrophilic–lipophilic balance of their repeating units, exhibit a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) in water associated to a characteristic coil–globule transition. In this work, thermo-responsive amphiphilic block copolymers are synthesized via reversible addition-fragmentation transfer (RAFT) polymerization starting from thermo-responsive monomers and a hydrophobic biodegradable macromonomer, oligo(caprolactone)methacrylate (CL3MA), produced via ring opening polymerization (ROP). The obtained copolymers exhibit an interesting self-assembly behavior leading to nanoparticles (NPs) as long as temperature is kept below the LCST. Otherwise, once this value is overcome, the destabilization of the NPs causes the formation of hydrophobic superstructures that enhance the release of an entrapped lipophilic drug. This characteristic behavior has been systematically studied and related to the copolymer structure. In particular, the self-assembly behavior as well as temperature-triggered NP destabilization have been related to the relative length of the two blocks constituting the copolymers and to their hydrophilic–lipophilic balance (HLB). Finally, the efficacy of the thermo-responsive triggered drug release has been tested in the case of Paclitaxel (PTX). © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J. Polym. Sci., Part A: Polym.

In particular, the ones stabilized by zwitterionic materials are gaining increased interest in medicine as alternative to the more common ones based on poly(ethylene glycol) thanks to their superior stability and ability to avoid both the accelerated blood clearance and allergic reactions. In this work, a novel class of zwitterionic based NPs has been produced, and a method to independently control the nanoparticle size, degradation time, and polymer molecular weight has been developed and demonstrated. This has been possible by the synthesis and the fine-tuning of zwitterionic amphiphilic block copolymers obtained via the combination of ring-opening polymerization and reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. The final results showed that when two block copolymers contain the same number of caprolactone units, the one with longer oligoester lateral chains degrades faster. This phenomenon is in sharp contrast with the one seen so far for the common linear polyester systems where longer chains result in longer degradation times, and it can be used to better tailor the degradation behavior of the nanoparticles."

Recent works suggest that Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), widely used for the analysis of biomolecular interactions, represents a technique of choice for rapid and quantitative analyses of the interaction between NPs-functionalized with specific ligands-and their putative biological targets. Moreover, SPR can provide important details on the formation and the role of the protein 'corona', i.e., the protein layer which coats NPs once they come into contact with biological fluids. These novel applications of SPR sensors may be very useful to characterize, screen and develop nanodevices for biomedical purposes. © 2012 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

  abstract: "All previously published results in the field of predicting copolymer reactivity and composition are collected, along with new, recently determined parameters. The copolymerizations of a variety of monomers, including styrene, acrylates, methacrylates and vinyl acetate, are investigated. In particular, the monomer and radical reactivity ratios for ST/HEMA, ST/GMA, ST/BMA, ST/HEA, MMA/VAc, ST/MMA, and ST/EA are calculated. Good agreement between the computational and experimental results is obtained for comparisons of the determined parameters with the experimental data available in the literature. In addition, some of the computed reactivity ratios are determined in this work for the first time, and they can be used as an initial guess for future experiments. © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

  abstract: "Free-radical copolymerization propagation kinetics of styrene (ST) and 2- hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) have been investigated using pulsed laser polymerization (PLP) combined with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and proton NMR. Monomer reactivity ratios for bulk ST/HEMA copolymerization are rHBMA = 0.49 and rST = 0.27, with no significant variation with temperature found between 50 and 120 °C. The composition-averaged copolymerization propagation rate coefficient, kPfiop, is well represented by the implicit penultimate unit effect (IPUE) model. The copolymerization kinetics of HEMA with ST is quite similar to that of glycidyl methacrylate (GMA) with ST. A computational study based on quantum chemistry supports the finding that GMA and HEMA are more reactive toward ST radicals compared to alkyl methacrylate s. © 2009 American Chemical Society."

  abstract: "In this work we used quantum mechanics hybrid models (QM/QM) to investigate the high-temperature polymerization of styrene with the aim of elucidating its elementary chemistry. High and low quality quantum mechanics calculations were performed at the B3LYP/6-31g(d,p) and PM3 levels, respectively. Reaction kinetic constants were calculated for oligomers composed of up to 6 styrene units with classic transition state theory on potential energy surfaces determined at the QM/QM level. The capability of this approach to predict kinetic constants of elementary processes relevant to styrene polymerization was validated through the satisfactory comparison with well-known experimental data. One of the main results of this study is that a new kinetic route is proposed to describe the polymer growth mechanism, in which the succession of backbiting and β scission reactions plays a critical role. In particular we found that the 7:3 backbiting reaction can proceed fast and influence significantly the polymer weight distribution. Finally, the so evaluated kinetic constants were introduced in a polymerization reactor model and used to compare the distribution of the produced oligomers measured experimentally with that predicted from first principles. The agreement with experimental data is good, suggesting that the proposed approach provides a valuable tool to investigate the kinetics of polymerization systems for which experimental data on elementary reactions are not available. © 2006 American Chemical Society."

  abstract: "The influence of the spacer arm on the interaction between agarose and a supported ligand was investigated through molecular dynamics for a combination of several spacers. The spacers differ for degree of hydrophobicity, length, and chemical composition, which was varied through insertion of thio, ether, and CH2 groups. Agarose was modeled through a modified Glycam force field, whose parameters were determined through ab initio calculations. The structural model of agarose used for the calculations was obtained through MD studies of the conformational evolution of several agarose single and double helixes. The simulations showed that a modification of the spacer properties could determine a change of the stable structure of the ligand with respect to the support. In particular, if the spacer is hydrophilic and rigid, the favored structure is with extended spacer and solvated ligand. Either increasing the spacer length, and thus its flexibility, or decreasing its solvation free energy, which corresponds to diminishing its affinity for water, rapidly leads to a conformational change in which the ligand adsorbs on agarose. Interestingly, we found that if the spacer is long and hydrophilic, a third metastable structure, in which the spacer is sandwiched between the ligand and agarose, is possible. Simulations of several ligands adsorbed on neighboring sites on agarose showed that if the support is not held fixed through restraints, the interaction force between vicinal ligands is sufficient to determine a major conformational change of the system. © 2006 American Chemical Society."

  abstract: "Throughout the last 25 years, computational chemistry based on quantum mechanics has been applied to the investigation of reaction kinetics in free radical polymerization (FRP) with growing interest. Nowadays, quantum chemistry (QC) can be considered a powerful and cost-effective tool for the kinetic characterization of many individual reactions in FRP, especially those that cannot yet be fully analyzed through experiments. The recent focus on copolymers and systems where secondary reactions play a major role has emphasized this feature due to the increased complexity of these kinetic schemes. QC calculations are well-suited to support and guide the experimental investigation of FRP kinetics as well as to deepen the understanding of polymerization mechanisms. This paper is intended to provide an overview of the most relevant QC results obtained so far from the investigation of FRP. A comparison between computational results and experimental data is given, whenever possible, to emphasize the performances of the two approaches in the prediction of kinetic data. This work provides a comprehensive database of reaction rate parameters of FRP to assist in the development of advanced models of polymerization and experimental studies on the topic."

  abstract: "Multipotent stem cells (SCs) could substitute damaged cells and also rescue degeneration through the secretion of trophic factors able to activate the endogenous SC compartment. Therefore, fetal SCs, characterized by high proliferation rate and devoid of ethical concern, appear promising candidate, particularly for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. Super Paramagnetic Iron Oxide nanoparticles (SPIOn), routinely used for pre-clinical cell imaging and already approved for clinical practice, allow tracking of transplanted SCs and characterization of their fate within the host tissue, when combined with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). In this work we investigated how SPIOn could influence cell migration after internalization in two fetal SC populations: human amniotic fluid and chorial villi SCs were labeled with SPIOn and their motility was evaluated. We found that SPIOn loading significantly reduced SC movements without increasing production of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS). Moreover, motility impairment was directly proportional to the amount of loaded SPIOn while a chemoattractant-induced recovery was obtained by increasing serum levels. Interestingly, the migration rate of SPIOn labeled cells was also significantly influenced by a degenerative surrounding. In conclusion, this work highlights how SPIOn labeling affects SC motility in vitro in a dose-dependent manner, shedding the light on an important parameter for the creation of clinical protocols. Establishment of an optimal SPIOn dose that enables both a good visualization of grafted cells by MRI and the physiological migration rate is a main step in order to maximize the effects of SC therapy in both animal models of neurodegeneration and clinical studies. © 2013 Diana et al."

  abstract: "Estimating the colloidal stability of polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) in biological environments is critical for designing optimal preparations and to clarify the fate of these devices after administration. To characterize and quantify the physical stability of nanodevices suitable for biomedical applications, spherical NPs composed of poly-lactic acid (PLA) and poly-methyl-methacrylate (PMMA), in the range 100-200 nm, were prepared. Their stability in salt solutions, biological fluids, serum and tissue homogenates was analyzed by dynamic light scattering (DLS). The PMMA NPs remained stable in all fluids, while PLA NPs aggregated in gastric juice and spleen homogenate. The proposed stability test is therefore useful to see in advance whether NPs might aggregate when administered in vivo. To assess colloidal stability ex vivo as well, spectrophotofluorimetric analysis was employed, giving comparable results to DLS. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V."

Bulk ring-opening polymerization of ε-caprolactone with 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA) as cocatalyst was carried out to produce various macromonomers composed of HEMA functionalized with 1-10 CL units. All of the HEMA-CL macromonomers have been characterized by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) and 1H NMR. For SEC analysis universal calibration was applied, and Mark-Houwink parameters for poly(HEMA-g-CL3) were obtained. Macromonomers with different CL chain length were polymerized through free radical polymerization, in both batch and semibatch emulsion polymerization to produce CL-based nanoparticles (NPs) with narrow particle size distribution. Various reactions parameters were investigated, namely the type of the emulsifier, the feeding conditions, and the macromonomer chain length.

  abstract: "The properties of the complex between fragment B of Protein A and the Fc domain of IgG were investigated adopting molecular dynamics with the intent of providing useful insight that might be exploited to design mimetic ligands with properties similar to those of Protein A. Simulations were performed both for the complex in solution and supported on an agarose surface, which was modeled as an entangled structure constituted by two agarose double chains. The energetic analysis was performed by means of the molecular mechanics Poisson Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA), molecular mechanics generalized Born surface area (MM/GBSA), and the linear interaction energy (LIE) approaches. An alanine scan was performed to determine the relative contribution of Protein A key amino acids to the complex interaction energy. It was found that three amino acids play a dominant role: Gln 129, Phe 132 and Lys 154, though also four other residues, Tyr 133, Leu 136, Glu 143 and Gln 151 contribute significantly to the overall binding energy. A successive molecular dynamics analysis of Protein A re-organization performed when it is not in complex with IgG has however shown that Phe 132 and Tyr 133 interact among themselves establishing a significant π-π interaction, which is disrupted upon formation of the complex with IgG and thus reduces consistently their contribution to the protein-antibody bond. The effect that adsorbing fragment B of Protein A on an agarose support has on the stability of the protein-antibody bond was investigated using a minimal molecular model and compared to a similar study performed for a synthetic ligand. It was found that the interaction with the surface does not hinder significantly the capability of Protein A to interact with IgG, while it is crucial for the synthetic ligand. These results indicate that ligand-surface interactions should be considered in the design of new synthetic affinity ligands in order to achieve results comparable to those of Protein A right from the ligand design stage. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract: "Synthetic polymers are attracting great attention in the last decades for their use in the biomedical field as nanovectors for controlled drug delivery, hydrogels and scaffolds enabling cell growth. Among them, polymers able to respond to environmental stimuli have been recently under growing consideration to impart a “smart” behavior to the final product, which is highly desirable to provide it with a specific dynamic and an advanced function. In particular, thermo-responsive polymers, materials able to undergo a discontinuous phase transition or morphological change in response to a temperature variation, are among the most studied. The development of the so-called controlled radical polymerization techniques has paved the way to a high degree of engineering for the polymer architecture and properties, which in turn brought to a plethora of sophisticated behaviors for these polymers by simply switching the external temperature. These can be exploited in many different fields, from separation to advanced optics and biosensors. The aim of this review is to critically discuss the latest advances in the development of thermo-responsive materials for biomedical applications, including a highly controlled drug delivery, mediation of cell growth and bioseparation. The focus is on the structural and design aspects that are required to exploit such materials for cutting-edge applications in the biomedical field."

  abstract: "Diagnostics and therapeutic treatments based on monoclonal antibodies have been attaining an increasing importance in the past decades, but their large scale employment requires the optimization of purification processes. To obtain this goal, research is focusing on affinity chromatography techniques and the development of new synthetic ligands. In this work we present a computational investigation aimed at obtaining some guidelines for the rational design of affinity ligands, through the study of their interactions with both monoclonal antibodies (modeled as the FC domain of human IgG) and a model support material (agarose). The study was carried out performing molecular dynamics simulations of the support-spacer-ligand-IgG complex in explicit water. Binding energies between IgG and two supported ligands, a disubstituted derivative of trichlorotriazine and a tetrameric peptide, were determined with the linear interaction energy and MM-GBSA approaches. A detailed study of the possible binding sites of the considered ligands was performed exploiting docking protocols and MD simulations. It was found that both ligands bind IgG in the same site as protein A, which is the hinge region between the CH2 and CH3 domains of IgG. However this site is not easily accessible and requires a high mobility of the ligands. The energetic analysis revealed that van der Waals and electrostatic energies of interaction of the triazine ligand with the support are significant and comparable to those with the protein, so that they limit its capability to reach the protein binding site. A similar result was found also for the tetrameric peptide, which is however able to circumvent the problem; for steric reasons only two of its arms can interact at the same time with the agarose support, thus leaving the remaining two available to bind the protein. These results indicate that the interaction between ligand and support material is an important parameter, which should be considered in the computational and experimental design of ligands for affinity chromatography. © 2008 American Chemical Society and American Institute of Chemical Engineers."

  abstract: "Quantum chemistry investigations have been performed to study the gas-phase chemistry active during the MOVPE of GaN when Ga(CH3)3 and NH3, diluted in a H2 carrier gas, are used as precursors. Optimized molecular geometries, energies, and transition-state structures of gas-phase species have been determined with density functional theory at the B3LYP/6-311+g(d,p) level. On the basis of the similarity with the soot formation mechanism active during hydrocarbon combustion, we propose that in this system a gas-phase chemistry is active and its reactivity is enhanced by a radical chain mechanism started from methyl radicals. Initiation reactions are surface processes or the pyrolysis of Ga(CH3)3. A propagation mechanism composed of fast radical reactions, most of which without an activation energy, was identified, and kinetic constants were determined for each step. The proposed mechanism is able to describe the formation of large GaN adducts formed by up to three R-Ga-NH units. These molecules can give fast cyclization reactions that lead to the formation of six-membered cyclic species, which, similar to benzene for combustion, are thermodynamically stable in vast temperature and pressure ranges and can thus be considered as the first GaN nuclei. We also found that the presence of H2 as a carrier gas can greatly enhance the rate of formation of gas-phase particles because it is a major source of atomic hydrogen, a promoter of gas-phase reactivity. © 2007 American Chemical Society."

  abstract: The improvement of the pharmacological profile of lipophilic drug formulations is one of the main successes achieved using nanoparticles (NPs) in medicine. However, the complex synthesis procedure and numerous post-processing steps hamper the cost-effective use of these formulations. In this work, an approach which requires only a syringe to produce self-assembling biodegradable and biocompatible poly(caprolactone)-based NPs is developed. The effective synthesis of monodisperse NPs has been made possible by the optimization of the block-copolymer synthesized via a combination of ring opening polymerization and reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization. These NPs can be used to formulate lipophilic drugs that are barely soluble in water, such as trabectedin, a potent anticancer therapeutic. Its biodistribution and antitumor activity have been compared with the commercially available formulation Yondelis®. The results indicate that this trabectedin NP formulation performs with the same antitumor activity as Yondelis®, but does not have the drawback of severe local vascular toxicity in the injection site.
